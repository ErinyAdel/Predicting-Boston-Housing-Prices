By spitting a dataset into training and testing subsets, we can train our model on the training subset, and then feed it with unseen data from the test subset to evaluate the performance of our model.

Training and testing on the same data doesn’t give us a genuine evaluation of the model, at it has already seen testing the data when training, and thus might not perform well in real-world scenarios where we often deal with unseen data. Related to this is the problem of “overfitting”, i.e. the model can be really accurate on the training data, but perform poorly on the training data.

Solution: Validation Set

***********************************************************************************************************************************************************************
○ Learning Curves
The following code cell produces four graphs for a decision tree model with different maximum depths. Each graph visualizes the learning curves of the model for both training and testing as the size of the training set is increased. The shaded region of a learning curve denotes the uncertainty of that curve (measured as the standard deviation). The model is scored on both the training and testing sets using R2, the coefficient of determination.

○ Complexity Curves
The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the learning curves, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the performance_metric function.


Looking at the learning curve for the model with max_depth = 3 (Plots in the project file)

The score of the training curve decreases as more training points are added. This happens because with fewer training points, the model can modify its paramters to better approximate the targets; but as the number of training points increases, perfectly fitting them becomes more difficult, and the training score goes down.
The score of the training curve increases as more training points are added, but there’s a slight dip after adding more than 350 training points. The score starts lower because the model has not yet learned enough to predict test points. As the model receives more training points, and hence, more information, it is better suited to predict unseen data.
The training and testing curve seem to be converging to a score of 0.8. This usually happens when the model has stretched its limits of extracting information from the training data even though more training points are being added. So the score stabilizes.
Therefore, having more training points might not benefit the model (with max_depth of 3).

Bias-Variance Tradeoff
Model trained with max_depth of 1: The model suffers from high bias at this depth. Looking at the graph, we can see that both training and validation scores are low, and similar. We can say that the model is over-simplified and is not capturing the underlying relationships present in the data for both training and validation datasets.

Model trained with max_depth of 10: The model suffers from high variance at this depth, and is overfitting on the training data. In the graph, we can see that the training score at this depth is almost equal to 1.0, while the validation score is lower, at around 0.7. The curves also seem to be diverging away from each other at this point.

In my opinion, a maximum depth of 3 results in a model that best generalizes to unseen data. That depth is the sweet spot for model complexity, as our model performs similar on training and validation data, while the overall score for both is still relatively high at between 0.7 to 0.8. A depth lower than that gives us poor training and validation score, while a higher depth overfits on the testing data, leading to a lower validation score.

									Evaluating Model Performance

○ Grid Search
The grid search technique is a systematic way of going through different combinations of parameter values while cross validating the results to determine the parameter combination which gives the best performance based on a scoring technique.

In order to optimize a learning algorithm, we can apply grid search by specifying the parameters, and the possible values of those parameters. The grid search then returns the best parameter values for our model, after fitting the supplied data. This takes out the guess-work involved in seeking out the opitimal paramter values for a classifier.

○ Cross-Validation
The k-fold crossvalidation training technique is a way of splitting the dataset into k partitions of equal size, and then running k separate learning experiments on the training data. In each of the experiments, we chose a training set of the size of k-1 partitions, train our model on that partition, and evaluate the results on the remaining test data. The results/scores for the k experiments are then averaged out.

This technique is benefitial when using grid search to optimize a model because it allows us to look for parameter settings that perform well for different test sets. If we had a single testing set, it’s easy to tune a model to perform well for that specific test set (and result in overfitting on the test set in this case), while cross validation allows us to generalize the results.
